# Binary Tree Right Side View

## Problem

Given the root of a binary tree, imagine yourself standing on the right side of it, return the values of the nodes you can see ordered from top to bottom.

## Example

![image](/images/day_36/1.jpeg)

```text
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,5,null,4]
Output: [1,3,4]
```

```text
Input: root = [1,null,3]
Output: [1,3]
```

```text
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

## Contraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100
