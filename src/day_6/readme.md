# Problem

Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root.

## Example

```text
Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3,6,9]
Output: [4,7,2,9,6,3,1]
```

```text
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: [2,3,1]
```

```text
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

## Contraints

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100
